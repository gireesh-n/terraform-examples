We have launched several EC2 instances by now, Did a thought of connecting to the instance cross your mind, if yes, the question arises, How?

We can create key pairs and register it in AWS and use this key to connect to an EC2 instance.

One can even use an existing key in AWS, to connect to the instance.

Below is the resource configuration, using which on can register the public key in AWS.

resource "aws_key_pair" "myfirstkey" {
      key_name   = "myfirstkey"
      public_key = file(var.PATH_TO_PUBLIC_KEY)
}
Let us create our first key pair and register the public key in AWS and then use the private key to connect to an EC2 instance.
